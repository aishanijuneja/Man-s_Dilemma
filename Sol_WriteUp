Solution Steps:
Identify the Cipher Type:
The hint suggests that the ciphertext is encrypted using a Vigenère cipher and that the key is the title of Kafka's book "In The Penal Colony".

Preprocess the Key:
Convert the key to a continuous string without spaces:

Original key: "In The Penal Colony"
Processed key: "InThePenalColony"
Align the Key with the Ciphertext:

Result:
By running the code in Mans_Dilemma_Solution , we decrypt the ciphertext "IyphchLhmlp" with the key "InThePenalColony" to get the plaintext:

Decrypted Message (Flag): AlwaysHuman

Conclusion:
The decrypted message is "AlwaysHuman", which is the flag for this challenge. This solution involves understanding the Vigenère cipher, preprocessing the key, and implementing the decryption algorithm in Python.
